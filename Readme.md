# Building and running the project

In order to be able to build and run the project, you must have the VCL (for visual component library) added to the root folder. The library is available at https://github.com/drohmer/inf585_vcl. You do not need the scenes folder for this, which is a folder containing practicals for the class, but just the library folder. (as well as License and Readme to keep the credit to the author)

IN ORDER TO BUILD AND RUN THE PROJECT, TYPE bash commands IN A TERMINAL (Linux environment), OR USE NORMAL CMAKE COMMANDS FOLLOWING WHAT IS WRITTEN IN THE commands.txt FILE.
